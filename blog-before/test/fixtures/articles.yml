  content: A musical instrument is a device constructed or modified for the purpose of making music. In principle, anything that produces sound can serve as a musical instrument. The term "musical instrument", however, is generally reserved for items that have a specific musical purpose such as a piano. The academic study of musical instruments is called organology.

  name: The Piano, a Marvelous Instrument
  content: The piano is a musical instrument played by means of a keyboard that produces sound by striking steel strings with felt hammers.
